    <h1>Next Stop: The Chalkverse!</h1>
    <h3>Official Game Rules &amp; Concept</h3>
    <p class="intro">Welcome travelers! The teleportation device on your spaceship has malfunctioned sending you and your crewmates to a strange and distant region in space known as the “Chalkverse”! Your ship has broken into four pieces and has been scattered all across its chalky planets. It’s now up to your team to gather the missing parts of your ship in order to return home.</p>
    <p><span class="directive">Your objective:</span> Collect all four pieces of your ship scattered around the board while completing the missions on your navigation device.</p>
    <p><span class="directive">How to play:</span> Divide your players into however many teams of two players or more if you’d like; you may also play as one group too. As a group, choose one of the four satellites (labelled entrances) around the teleporter (fountain) to start at. Give each of your crews a name and pick a captain for each. The captain scans the QR code at the satellite entry point to navigate your crew around the board and check off the pieces of your ship that you find. The first team to collect all of the ship pieces and return to the teleporter with the most points wins.</p>
    <p><span class="directive">Rules:</span><ol>
      <li>All teams start together at one of the four <span class="keyword">satellites</span>.</li>
      <li>Name your crew and pick a captain. The captain will be the navigation device user.</li>
      <li>Click the red button on your navigation device and move to the closest corresponding colored square.</li>
      <li>Read aloud to your crew the <span class="keyword">mission</span> that appears on your screen and decide as a team if you will accept it or not.</li>
      <li>Once completing a mission, add the points to your counter on the device.</li>
      <li>Once your crew has completed one side of the game, choose one of the two satellites on the other side and continue from there.</li>
      <li>The game ends once all the pieces of the ship have been collected by each team and everyone successfully makes it back to the teleporter.</li>
      <li>The first team to collect all of the ship pieces and return to the teleporter gets a bonus 20 points, second team 15 points and the third team gets 10 points. All teams after that get a 5 point bonus.</li>
      <li>The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!</li>
